   <strong>Assistant Manager | Timberland</strong>
   <P class="date"> Sept 2020 - Present</P>
   <p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <li>Received stock signed the waybill bill received also another staff member can signed as well for witness
    </li>
    <li>
      Count stock manually and write it down on our GRM book 
    </li>
    <li>
      Also open box under camera so they can see we received stock for our courier (RTT)
    </li>
    <li>
      Confirm with Roxanne if stock match with stock waybill they sent us 
    </li>
    <li>
      if there is stock missing or even damage we should report and take a picture on our phone of box received or stock is over we should still report 
    </li>
    <li>
      Do staff rostering on Excell: 195 hours a month for full-time employees and flexi under 150 hours a month 
    </li>
    <li>
      Do Banking: cash the money received previous day and bank it if it fall on a Sunday or Public holiday we should bank it the following day 
    </li>
    <li>
      During the day we do Merchandising or count our weekly stock and check if stock match with our POS (SHOPIFY)
    </li>
    <li>
      Help walk-in Customers assist them with their needs such as shoe size check if we do have and if we don’t have their size or shoe we check on Shopify which branch have it and explain we can get them the shoe from a branch, which do however have a courier fee of R50(Local: Gauteng area) of R150(outside of Gauteng area)
    </li>
    <li>
      Do IBT’s for customers from one store to ours: we check on shopify which store have the item then confirm with customer if they still want it, then phone store to make sure they have the item in question then email and cc Roxanne to IBT the item to our store. The courier company that does our IBT’s are Courier guy
    </li>
    <li>
      We also have Lay-buy which we offer customers if they can’t afford the entire amount immediately and have to explain how the process works: They pay 30% of the shoe value example if the shoe cost R3000 which 30% is R900 and then they have to pay it of in 3 months they can pay any amount as long as they pay it off in 3 months, we do require an ID and just basic details such as their name, surname, phone number and email address 
    </li>
    <li>
      We also have PJN (Pay Just Now) which is kinda-of a lay-buy system but a 3rd party handles it, how it works we explain to customers they need to download an app on their phone through the app store, the app going to ask them personal details such as their address, how much do they earn and it will give them a credit limit and after this they can start buying an item we explain at the counter they just need to scan to pay we will get a notification on our email that payment has been received after this we ring it up on shopify and then the happy customer can leave with their brand new shirt or shoe they bought 
    </li>
    <li>
      Assign staff member to do task such as cleaning store changing shelfs also do stock count
    </li>
    <li>
      Do also exchange and refunds to customers: when we receive an item for exchange from customer we ask customers the nature of the exchange is it too small or too big we check if the item is still in a sellable condition and then do the exchange, for refunds we check if the item is still in a sellable condition and ask the reason for the refunds such as they change their mind or it was a gift for debit cards we do cash refunds and credit cards we ask customers to present us with the credit card they bought it and also ID to confirm if this is the ID of the card holder then we refund his credit card which does take 5 business days depending on the bank
    </li>
    <li>
      At the end of the day I do a financial report and email it to our admin and cc our Regional manager: in the financial report we count the money and state what we received and check what amount it states on shopify and also our credit card machine we do a batch report and compare the total with our total on shopify just like our cash.
    </li>
